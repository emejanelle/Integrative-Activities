        <h3>What is the difference between for and while loops?</h3>
        <p>In a for loop, the number of iterations is predetermined or specified. The code will continue to execute until the specified condition is met. The while loop iteration, on the other hand, is not defined. The loop continuously iterates through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true, and will only stop once the condition is no longer met. </p>

        <h3>Why is the else block important in conditional statements?</h3>
        <p>The else condition serves as an alternative when the main (if) condition is not met. </p>

        <h3>How can loops make a program more efficient? </h3>
        <p>Loops reduces the redundancy of codes.</p>
