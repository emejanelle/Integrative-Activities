        <h3>Why is JavaScript important in web development?</h3>
        <p><i>Javascript(JS)</i> is one of the three languages used in web development. JS can update and change the behaviors of elements within the HTML and CSS file such as use of animations, and user interface enhancement, making the website interactive and more appealing to  the users. Additioanally, JS have numerous libraries and frameworks making the development process simplier.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript Variables can be declared in four (4) ways: (a)Automatically, (b) Using var, (c) Using let, (d) Using const. These variables are used for storing data.
            <br><br>

        <b><i>Var</i></b> - Declares variables with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope. Re-declaration of variable/s overwrites the previous value or data it stores.
        <br> 
        <b><i>Let</i></b> - Declares variables with block scope, allowing updates but not re-declaration within the same block. Block-level scoping means the variable is only accessible within the block (like loops or conditionals) where it is declared.
        <br>
        <b><i>Const</i></b> - or constant, declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if you try to use a variable before declaring it?</h3>
        <p>
        The behavior of the variable depends on how the variable if declared. Whereas, using a <i>var</i> variable before its declaration will return <b>undefined</b>. While <b>RefenceError</b> for both <i>let</i> and <i>const</i>
