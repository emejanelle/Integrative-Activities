        <h3>What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?</h3>
        <p> <i>Function declaration</i> is a function statement that uses a <b>keyword or a function name</b>. They are standalone construct that doesn't require variable assignment; and can be accessed before and/or after the function declaration - they are hoisted. Additionally, these are executed before any other code. While, <i>function expression</i> is similar to the former but without a function name. Additionally, it <b>can be stored in a variable assignment1; can be accessed only after the function definition; and loaded and executed only when the program reaches the line of code.
        </p>

        <h3>Why should we use functions in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>Using function in programming can minimize declaration of similar values or operations within our code - it makes a piece of block of code/s reusable. Function makes your code more concise, clean, and readable by breaking down complex problems into smaller and manageable pieces of codes.</p>

        <h3>How do operators help in decision-making in a program?</h3>
        <p>Operators allow programs to evaluate conditions and make decisions based on those conditions. They enable the program to perform different actions depending on whether certain criteria are met. This makes the code more dynamic and responsive to various situations.</p>
